 * memory map the schema.
 *
 * Should help keep memory usage to a minimum even with lots of schemas & since
 * all this will be read-only, they are easier to swap out.
 *
 * This class is not thread safe at the moment
 * (do not share a JSchemaFile object across threads).  If you find this is a common
 * pattern, let the maintainer know.
 *
 * <palm-internal-comment>
 * Direct usage of this class will likely go away in the future - instead upper layers
 * (i.e. luna service bus) will automatically handle most schema work for you.
 *
 * For now though, this class is the recommended mechanism for utilizing schemas.
